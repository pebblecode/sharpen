# .net MVC bootstrap

## Web support

Support for plain html/css/js.

To setup:

1. Install [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/)
2. To start the server (with [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/) and [livereload](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-livereload)):

    grunt --force

(`--force` is to make sure jshint doesn't stop the server if there is an error)
