# Sharpen

Sharpen your skills.

A hackday project for [HackEd 2.0](http://www.amiando.com/hacked-london.html?page=942710).

## Development

### Web

Support for plain html/css/js.

To setup:

1. Install [gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/)
2. To start the server (with [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/) and [livereload](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-livereload)):

    grunt --force

(`--force` is to make sure jshint doesn't stop the server if there is an error)
